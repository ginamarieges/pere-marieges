FOODTOPIA is placed in a traditionally agricultural and highly anthropised territory where agricultural activity should be protected while contributing to the generation of economic and leisure activity in the urban environment. At the same time, it works as a backbone for the network of cities and infrastructures that surround it, becoming a mosaic of agricultural, forestry and urban spaces that create synergies between them and deny division and limits. It is organised as a network, following the topographical outlines of the territory. It enters the Vallès plain through five fingers that follow river corridors from Barcelona. Along them, there are areas of agricultural centrality, areas which still enjoy a certain continuity in their activity, and because of that they should be specially protected. These are also the reference leisure areas for the towns and villages that surround them. FOODTOPIA is shaped like a funnel, whose neck is the PLA DE REIXAC, which is the closest space to Barcelona and the one that acts as a node, connecting this currently vulnerable territory with the city. Like most of the territories that make up FOODTOPIA, the continuity of the Pla de Reixac as an agricultural area is threatened by the main problems affecting farmers, the main one being the profitability of cultivated areas. In this context, a transformation of the farming model of the Pla de Reixac is proposed, from a conventional model to an agro-pastoral model where the different productive activities are part of a single agri-food system, establishing synergies and closed flows. The introduction of a sheep farm is the first step towards a more sustainable management of agricultural activity. It acts as a link and a reference point for citizens, bringing the productive activity of the Pla closer to the city.
