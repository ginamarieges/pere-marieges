Cala Millor, located on the east coast of Mallorca, stands out as a popular seaside resort in the Balearic Islands. During the summer season, its population multiplies almost three times due to its tourist attraction. However, this environment has undergone a significant transformation with an impact on its natural ecosystem.

The lack of adequate planning has led to the alteration of the natural dune system of Cala Millor beach, which has caused the dry beach to become less extensive, putting the valuable tourist resources of the area at risk.

This urban beach has a dynamic cycle of natural sediment transfer, both in the emerged and submerged zones, and from the south to the north. However, urbanization has negatively affected the beach's ability to recover from erosion. As a result, local and regional administrations, coastal managers and the tourism sector requested interdisciplinary scientific advice to better understand the coastal evolution of the beach.

In Cala Millor, multiple public and national entities exercise their competences. Strategically located between Sant Lloren√ß des Cardassar and Son Servera, Mallorca, it has at the island level the Consell Insular, which plays a key role in coastal management. At the regional level, various General Directorates intervene in key areas such as climate change, energy, tourism, water resources, among others. Coordination and collaboration between these entities are essential to ensure the protection and sustainability of this coastal enclave.

Facing the challenges of climate change, Cala Millor is looking for sustainable solutions to preserve its beaches and its touristic charm. The LIFE AdaptCalaMillor project addresses the causes, consequences and effects of climate change in this coastal region, with the active collaboration of all stakeholders sharing interests and competences on this bay.

LIFE AdaptCalaMillor represents a governance project with the purpose of promoting adaptation to climate change in the beach system and the urban area of the bay of Cala Millor. Its primary objective is to strengthen the resilience of infrastructure, ecosystem services and socioeconomics to the impacts of climate change in the long term. This is an ambitious project for the period 2023-2027, which will focus on new science-based methodologies and participatory and governance schemes to improve the understanding of physical processes on an urban beach and anticipate possible changes in its morphology in response to global climate change scenarios.

The LIFE AdaptCalaMillor project consists of 10 partners from both public and private entities with multidisciplinary profiles: regional and local authorities, business associations, research institutes and environmental foundations.
