description: Starting from an initial exercise of placing the piece Habitación vegetal by Cristina Iglesias in a point of the park, water becomes a central element of  the project, both when constructing the program as when considering the building. In addition, the boundary condition between land and water also becomes one of the most important elements.
    The first intervention of the proposal is the consolidation of the earthen dyke that marks this limit, while at the same time creating a marsh in the lake. It is in this intermediate point of marsh where the building is located.
    The access to the building is via walkways over the water. The building consists of two parts: the pavilion itself, which contains the research, work and teaching spaces, and a lookout tower which is a landmark in the landscape.
    The pavilion that contains the main uses is characterized by a U-shaped plan. The façade is characterized by the latticework of carved wood, generating a very compact ensemble from a distance that is revealed as one gets closer. This set is pierced in its central part by an outdoor space, which allows it to act as a window to the landscape of the lake, so that the view over this space from the park is preserved, and not making it exclusive to the building.
