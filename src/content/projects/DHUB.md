Anatomy of a Beach is an installation created specifically for the exhibition at Disseny Hub Barcelona The ocean speaks. New ecologies and new economies of the seas, curated by Jos√© Luis de Vicente. The exhibition analyzes the effects of human activity on marine ecosystems and reflects on how cities can redesign their relationship with the sea through a discourse based on innovation.
In this context, La Pineda beach, in the municipality of Vila-Seca, on the Camp de Tarragona plain, the center of an imaginary amphitheater open to the sea and surrounded by the Prades mountains, the Llaberia mountain range, and the Mola de Colldejou, exemplifies the past and future transformations of the world's beaches. Around a third of the world's coastline is occupied by sandy beaches. The beach is a habitat and a space of mediation between land and sea, between the urban and the natural, between the fixed and the changing. The beach that was, the beach that is, and the beach that will be stores shared stories on most of the planet's urbanized coastlines.
