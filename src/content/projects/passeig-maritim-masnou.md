Today, coastal regression is one of the biggest problems in coastal areas around the world. The concentration of economic activity in areas close to the sea and urban growth in these areas due to a growing tourist activity, added to the effects derived from climate change such as sea level rise, has led to a fragmentation of the coast. Moreover, engineering structures have altered the natural dynamics of sediment supply, weakening all those coastal protection elements such as beaches and resulting in a loss of habitats and biodiversity and an increase in the exposure of vulnerable areas.

Based on the importance of the two creeks that delimit the municipality, the Alella and the Teià, the new promenade is considered as the element that unites them, always looking at the coastal dynamics and what happens at every moment in relation to the sea.

Thus, the proposal for the new Masnou coastal front is based on a characterization of it in four type sections. The first is the one that starts in the southern part of the municipality, where a breakwater is placed and contains sea pools with a bathing area. This breakwater makes it possible to fix a beach area that houses a lagoon that increases the area where water currently accumulates at the end of the stream, filtering the water before pouring it into the sea.

The next section begins after the roundabout at the entrance to Masnou, and is characterized by being the reverse priority area and where one of the structuring elements of the project begins: the pine forest. In this strip, the promenade area widens and contains a sports area among the pines, placing some of the activities that until now were carried out on the beach but at a safe level considering sea level rise.

The third section is the one that establishes a more direct relationship with the beach. Next to the promenade is a double dune system that contains a wetland area that with the same function as the lagoon: it collects water from creeks and filters it before discharging it into the sea.
Finally, the last stretch forms a buffer, an intermediate landscape that generates an area of calm waters designed for practicing sea sports, while taking advantage of the low depth to generate an area of salt marshes and create new habitats.
